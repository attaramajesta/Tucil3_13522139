## General Information
- The Word Ladder Solver is a Java application designed to find the shortest transformation sequence between two words in a given dictionary. It employs various search algorithms, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A*


## Technologies Used
- Java - version 11.0.6
- Tech 2 - version 2.0
- Tech 3 - version 3.0


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Algorithm selection
- Path Visualization
- Generate random words

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ 


## Room for Improvement
- Integration of Bidirectional BFS: Implementing Bidirectional BFS could potentially reduce search time by exploring paths from both the start and end words simultaneously.
- Dynamic Dictionary Loading: Allow users to load custom dictionaries dynamically from external files or online sources, expanding the range of words available for word ladder solutions.

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the classic word ladder problem.
- The implementation of algorithms was based on lectures and materials from the IF2211 Algorithm Strategy course at the Institut Teknologi Bandung.
- Many thanks to the teaching assistant and professors who provided guidance and support throughout the course.
